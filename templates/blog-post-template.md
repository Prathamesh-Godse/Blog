## Introduction

Briefly introduce the topic in a natural way.  
Explain what you were dealing with and why this was worth exploring.  
Keep it friendly, clear, and lightly technical.

---

## Writing

Walk through the process as it happened.

Explain things while doing them:
- what you tried
- why you tried it
- what worked
- what didn’t
- what confused you
- what clicked later

Use commands, code, and explanations inline.

```bash
# example
command --option value
````

This section is free-flowing.
Write it the way you would explain it to someone sitting next to you.

---

## Conclusion

Summarize where you ended up.

* What you understand now
* What changed in your thinking
* What you’d do differently next time (if anything)

No need for certainty or plans — just close the loop.

## References

* Documentation
* Articles
* Man pages
* Notes you may want to revisit
